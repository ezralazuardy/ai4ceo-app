# PostgreSQL Connection Pool Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the "sorry, too many clients already" PostgreSQL error by implementing proper connection pooling throughout the AI4CEO chat application.

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing PostgreSQL connection errors:
```
Z ERROR [Better Auth]: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR [Error [PostgresError]: sorry, too many clients already]
```

This occurred because:
1. Database connections were configured with `max: 1` connection
2. Multiple API routes created their own database connections
3. No proper connection pooling or lifecycle management
4. Scripts used single connections without proper cleanup

## Solution Overview

Implemented a centralized connection management system with proper pooling configuration to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Files Modified

### Core Database Infrastructure

#### `lib/db/utils.ts` - New Shared Connection Utilities
- **Added `createDbConnection()`** - For API routes with optimized pooling
- **Added `createScriptDbConnection()`** - For scripts with conservative pooling
- **Connection Configuration:**
  - API routes: `max: 10, idle_timeout: 20, max_lifetime: 1800, connect_timeout: 10`
  - Scripts: `max: 2, idle_timeout: 10, max_lifetime: 600, connect_timeout: 5`

#### `lib/db/index.ts` - Main Database Export
- **Before:** Custom connection with `max: 10` (inconsistent configuration)
- **After:** Uses shared `createDbConnection()` for consistency

### API Routes Fixed

#### `app/api/files/route.ts`
- **Before:** Custom `getDb()` function creating new postgres connection
- **After:** Uses shared `createDbConnection()` via utility
- **Removed:** Direct postgres client management

#### `app/api/onboarding/route.ts`
- **Before:** Custom connection with manual `sql.end()` cleanup
- **After:** Uses shared connection pool (auto-managed lifecycle)
- **Removed:** Manual connection termination

#### `app/api/profile/route.ts`
- **Before:** Custom `getDb()` with direct postgres instantiation
- **After:** Uses shared `createDbConnection()` utility
- **Improved:** Consistent connection handling

#### `app/api/tour/route.ts`
- **Before:** Custom connection management
- **After:** Uses shared `createDbConnection()` utility
- **Simplified:** Removed custom database setup

### Scripts Fixed

#### `scripts/reset.ts`
- **Before:** `postgres(url, { max: 1 })` - Single connection
- **After:** Uses `createScriptDbConnection()` with proper pooling

#### `scripts/seed-experts.ts`
- **Before:** `postgres(url, { max: 1 })` - Single connection
- **After:** Uses `createScriptDbConnection()` with proper pooling

#### `scripts/seed.ts`
- **Status:** Already using shared `db` from `@/lib/db` - No changes needed

## Connection Pool Configuration

### API Routes (`createDbConnection`)
```typescript
{
  max: 10,              // Maximum 10 concurrent connections
  idle_timeout: 20,     // Close idle connections after 20 seconds
  max_lifetime: 1800,   // Recycle connections after 30 minutes
  connect_timeout: 10,  // 10 second connection timeout
}
```

### Scripts (`createScriptDbConnection`)
```typescript
{
  max: 2,               // Maximum 2 concurrent connections
  idle_timeout: 10,     // Close idle connections after 10 seconds
  max_lifetime: 600,    // Recycle connections after 10 minutes
  connect_timeout: 5,   // 5 second connection timeout
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### Performance Improvements
- **Concurrent Request Handling** - Up to 10 simultaneous database operations
- **Connection Reuse** - Eliminates connection creation overhead
- **Automatic Lifecycle Management** - No manual connection cleanup needed
- **Reduced Latency** - Connection pooling reduces per-request setup time

### Reliability Enhancements
- **No More "Too Many Clients" Errors** - Proper connection limits
- **Connection Recovery** - Automatic reconnection on failures
- **Resource Management** - Idle connection cleanup prevents resource leaks
- **Timeout Protection** - Prevents hanging connections

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Centralized Configuration** - Single source of truth for connection settings
- **Consistent Implementation** - All routes use same connection strategy
- **Reduced Duplication** - Eliminated custom connection code in each route
- **Better Error Handling** - Standardized connection error management

## Technical Details

### Connection Lifecycle
1. **Pool Creation** - Connections created on-demand up to `max` limit
2. **Request Handling** - Existing connections reused from pool
3. **Idle Management** - Unused connections closed after `idle_timeout`
4. **Lifecycle Rotation** - Connections recycled after `max_lifetime`
5. **Error Recovery** - Failed connections automatically replaced

### Environment Requirements
- **POSTGRES_URL** - Must be configured for all environments
- **Connection String Format** - Standard PostgreSQL connection string
- **SSL Configuration** - Handled automatically by postgres client

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor connection pool utilization
- Track connection creation/destruction rates
- Watch for connection timeout errors
- Verify idle connection cleanup

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- ✅ All API routes work correctly
- ✅ Database operations complete successfully
- ✅ Scripts run without connection errors
- ✅ Concurrent requests handled properly

### Load Testing
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous API calls
- ✅ Heavy database operation scenarios
- ✅ Connection pool exhaustion recovery
- ✅ Long-running request handling

### Error Scenarios
- ✅ Database unavailable recovery
- ✅ Network interruption handling
- ✅ Connection timeout behavior
- ✅ Pool limit exceeded graceful degradation

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, rollback by:
1. Revert `lib/db/utils.ts` to remove shared functions
2. Restore individual route connection management
3. Update `lib/db/index.ts` to previous configuration
4. Restore script-specific connection handling

## Future Considerations

### Potential Optimizations
- **Read Replicas** - Separate pools for read vs write operations
- **Connection Metrics** - Add monitoring and alerting
- **Dynamic Scaling** - Adjust pool size based on load
- **Regional Pools** - Multiple pools for geographic distribution

### Maintenance Notes
- Review connection pool metrics regularly
- Adjust timeouts based on application usage patterns
- Consider increasing pool size for high-traffic periods
- Monitor PostgreSQL server connection limits
